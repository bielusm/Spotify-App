# Spotify-App
This app allows you to manage your playlists and control your Spotify playlists at the same time. I made this out of a desire to manage multiple playlists at the same time. 

**Note:** 
1. This only works with premium Spotify accounts
2. This software should be used at your own risk. Consider backing up your playlists before using this program. 

## [Check it out here](https://spotify.bielusm.me/)

## Features
1. Controlling music remotely (next track, prev track, play/pause, like song)
2. Live display of what you're listening to
3. Live update if current song is in choosen playlists. The user can add or remove the playlists if it's not. 

## To build locally
1. Clone the repository
2. run "npm install"
3. run "npm run server" for a local webpack server or "npm run build" to build the program.
